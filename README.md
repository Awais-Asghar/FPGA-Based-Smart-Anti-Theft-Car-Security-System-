A concealed and reprogrammable smart anti-theft system designed using Verilog HDL and system verilog for high-end vehicles such as Porsche. This project enhances security by detecting unauthorized access, activating an audible alarm, and securely disabling the fuel pump unless the correct hidden owner-authenticated sequence is performed.

## üß© Overview

Imagine someone buys a fancy new car, like a Porsche. It already has a built-in anti-theft system, but the owner is still worried that thieves might know how to disable it. So, our job was to design a smarter, hidden anti-theft system that‚Äôs harder to bypass ‚Äî something only the owner knows how to deactivate. So, we need a system that:
o	Automatically turns on after the driver leaves the car.
o	Detects if someone opens the car door.
o	Gives the real owner some time to start the car before sounding an alarm.
o	Triggers a loud siren if the car is being accessed wrongly.
o	Blocks the fuel pump secretly, so even if someone disables the siren, they can't drive away.

## How the System Works 
Think of the system like a guard dog that:
o	Sleeps quietly until you leave the house.
o	Starts watching when the house is empty.
o	If someone opens the door, it gives them a few seconds ‚Äî if they don‚Äôt prove they belong, it starts barking (alarm).
o	And secretly, it locks the fuel line so even if the thief stops the barking, the car won‚Äôt move.

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auto-Arming**       | Activates automatically when ignition is off and all doors are closed       |
| **Countdown Timer**   | Starts countdown on door opening, awaits ignition input                     |
| **Siren Alarm**       | Loud siren triggered if countdown expires without valid disarm              |
| **Fuel Pump Lock**    | Blocks fuel pump unless correct disarm combo (brake + hidden switch)        |
| **LED Indicator**     | Blinks in Armed mode, stays solid in Triggered and Alarm modes              |
| **Configurable Timers**| Reprogrammable delay values for arm, driver, passenger, and alarm intervals |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Parameters

| Interval              | Symbol           | Default Time (sec) | Binary Value |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Arming Delay          | `T_ARM_DELAY`    | 6                   | `0110`       |
| Driver Door Countdown | `T_DRIVER_DELAY` | 8                   | `1000`       |
| Passenger Door Delay  | `T_PASSENGER_DELAY` | 15              | `1111`       |
| Siren Alarm Duration  | `T_ALARM_ON`     | 10                  | `1010`       |

These values are stored in memory and can be reprogrammed at runtime.

## ‚úÖ Simulation Checklist

- [x] **FSM Behavior**: Verified transitions between all states (Armed, Triggered, Alarm, Disarmed)
- [x] **Timer Accuracy**: All time intervals matched expected durations
- [x] **Siren Modulation**: Alternating 440Hz and 880Hz tones confirmed
- [x] **Fuel Pump Lock**: Disarm sequence required to restore pump power
- [x] **LED Indicator**: Correct status signal behavior (blinking, solid, off)
- [x] **Debouncer**: Inputs free from glitches or spurious toggles
- [x] **Time Reprogrammability**: Parameters updated and reflected immediately
- [x] **Testbenches**: Each module tested independently in ModelSim

## üìà Results

Below are key results verified from simulations and waveform analyses:

- ‚úÖ **Auto-Arming Delay**: System enters Armed state exactly **6 seconds** after ignition off and all doors closed.
- ‚úÖ **Driver Door Trigger**: Countdown of **8 seconds** starts upon driver door open. LED solid during countdown.
- ‚úÖ **Siren Behavior**: Siren asserts if countdown expires, alternating tones confirmed via waveform.
- ‚úÖ **Fuel Pump Safety**: Fuel pump remains OFF until **brake + hidden switch** are pressed under ignition.
- ‚úÖ **Parameter Update**: New values loaded during reprogramming reflected instantly in next FSM cycle.
- ‚úÖ **No Metastability**: Debouncer module ensures all transitions are clean and glitch-free.
- ‚úÖ **FSM Coverage**: All FSM transitions including resets, armed/triggered/alarm/disarm verified.
